This is where Droidhub.net utilities are maintained.  The primary interface will
very likely be web based, at Github.net.  However, the actual tools that do the
work will be written in C, and they will work from the command line, and should
port easily to Windows and Mac OS X.

The primary tool will be 'droid', which will allow you to search for packages,
install and uninstall them in your application directory, deal with
dependencies, create your own packages, and publish them.  Check the
droidhub.net web site for more info.
